This plugin lets you use filetype-dependent templates for new files, using a simple but effective mechanism.

It is, in various ways, a more sophisticated approach to the same problem that vimscript #1160 addresses, but doesn't try to do quite as much.

When you start a fresh buffer, setting a filetype on it will load the corresponding template. E.g. open Vim and issue

    :setf html

You should find a skeleton HTML file, ready to fill in.

One new command has been added for convenience: it is called :New and takes exactly one argument. It will open a new empty window and set the filetype for it to the argument given.

A handful of templates are included, but the real purpose of the plugin is to allow you to easily create your own.
